My progress with typescript. Im making a Ball class to order balls from,
which eventually should move around a container of 500px x 500px. Im going to use pixi.js 
framework to   make the graphics. there is a drawCircle method that im going to implement next 
altough im quite sure of how how im going to do that yet. Possibly within a class method
