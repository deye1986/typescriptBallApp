My progress with typescript and pixi.js framework.

02.08 - <strong> I think my script is stuck in a loop <strong>, when i use jsbin an online environment 
for typescript the console goes crazy not like ive ever seen before. if anybody comes across 
this script take caution running it because i only noticed when my browser stoped responding
after about 3 mins so youl have plenty of time to stop the script. in jsbin deactivate 'auto run javascript'
thats what i did and it worked. im might have trouble debuging because of this problem.
i checked the task manager and the cpu had a lot of jobs than usual. Im wondering how this 
happened and i suspect it is the for loop at the bottom, im not sure how ive managed to get a
for loop stuck, i suspect its the condition and the sentry variable 'i' is not working, or ive mistyped
some syntax.

02.08 - It worked! from a Ball class, 6 blue coloured circular objects rendered in the container 
ordered from Ball and stored in an array, so progress made and im on the way. 
I feel like im really begining to think like a programmer now with my fresh approach to this task.
A for loop iterates over the array and hopefully will stop on the last item in the list...
Unfortunatley it doesnt stop and the console spits out some very interesting javaScript. Im not
sure what is going on but il find out no doubt as im making good progress and i also fell im
building momentum.

30.07 - Im making a Ball class to order balls from,
which eventually should move around a container of 500px x 500px. Im going to use pixi.js 
framework to   make the graphics. there is a drawCircle method that im going to implement next 
altough im not quite sure of how how im going to do that yet. Possibly within a class method.
